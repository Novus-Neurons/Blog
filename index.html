      <h3><b>The Similarities of Solving Data Problems and Rubik’s Cubes</b></h3>
      <h5>Data Strategist, <span class="w3-opacity">September 27, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-grey">
      <p>In 1974, two distinct but interestingly similar milestones were achieved that would greatly affect the lives of data engineers: the Rubik’s Cube was invented, and IBM released the first relational database.
        Since its original rise in the 1980s, the Rubik’s Cube has become the world’s most popular puzzle toy. Over 400 million Rubik’s Cubes have been sold in the last four decades. 
        The constant release of more complex variants, as well as the popularity of speedcubing competitions around the world, has kept the Rubik’s Cube just as challenging and relevant in 2022 as it was in 1982.
        Data emerged as the business world’s most valuable resource with the embrace of OLTP databases in the 1980s, business intelligence and data warehouses in the 1990s, 
        big data analytics in the 2000s, machine learning and data science in the 2010s, and now real-time AI and customer personalization systems.
        Worldwide investment in data and analytics is growing from $216 billion in 2021 to $349 billion in 2025, according to IDC, a CAGR of 12.8 percent. 
        With every business today becoming data-driven, DataOps has never been more mission-critical nor more challenging.
        
        In this blog, I’ll explore some striking similarities between solving a Rubik’s Cube and managing DataOps. I have also included a link to relevant background sources covering DataOps and data engineering topics with each point.<div class="w3-row">

      <p>Today’s enterprise data infrastructures are far more complex than those of yesteryear. 
        They are multi-layered systems consisting of on-premises and cloud data repositories, old-school data lakes, data warehouses, data marts, and newer lakehouses and delta lakes. 
        They ingest data from a network of real-time and batch streams leveraging Kafka and other event publishing middleware and pump out data to a constantly-changing web of reporting dashboards, real-time data applications, machine learning feature stores, and more. 
        And rather than storing gigabytes or terabytes of data, their combined repositories hold petabytes or even exabytes of data.      <div class="w3-row">

    <h3><b>OpenAI   </b></h3>
    <h5>DALL.E <span class="w3-opacity">Introducing Outpainting</span></h5>
  </div>
  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>OpenAI comes from industry experts who want to bring AI to the masses.
       It's linked to the non-profit research company OpenAI, co-chaired by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, and sponsored by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Infosys who are trying to make AI accessible—hence the name.
       Contributors discuss their collective efforts to promote and advance AI technologies through long-term research. 
       It’s a valuable resource for anyone interested in the future of AI.
       DALL·E’s Edit feature already enables changes within a generated or uploaded image — a capability known as Inpainting.
       Now, with Outpainting, users can extend the original image, creating large-scale images in any aspect ratio. 
       Outpainting takes into account the image’s existing visual elements — including shadows, reflections, and textures — to maintain the context of the original image.
       More than one million people are using DALL·E, the AI system that generates original images and artwork from a natural language description, 
       as a creative tool today. Artists have already created remarkable images with the new Outpainting feature,
       and helped us better understand its capabilities in the process.
       Outpainting is now available to all DALL·E users on desktop. To discover new realms of creativity, visit labs.openai.com or join the waitlist.     <div class="w3-row">

  <h3><b>Automatic Text Summarisation</b></h3>
  <h5>DALL.E <span class="w3-opacity">Introducing Outpainting</span></h5>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
  <p>This work proposes an approach to address automatic
    text summarization. This approach is a trainable summarizer, which
    takes into account several features, including sentence position,
    positive keyword, negative keyword, sentence centrality, sentence
    resemblance to the title, sentence inclusion of name entity, sentence
    inclusion of numerical data, sentence relative length, Bushy path of
    the sentence and aggregated similarity for each sentence to generate
    summaries. First we investigate the effect of each sentence feature on
    the summarization task. Then we use all features score function to
    train genetic algorithm (GA) and mathematical regression (MR)
    models to obtain a suitable combination of feature weights. The
    proposed approach performance is measured at several compression
    rates on a data corpus composed of 100 English religious articles.
    The results of the proposed approach are promising <div class="w3-row">

      <h3><b>Google Sidelines Engineer Who Claims Its A.I. Is Sentient</b></h3>
      <h5>Blake Lemoine, the engineer, says that Google’s language model has a soul. The company disagrees.<span class="w3-opacity">September 27, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>
	Google placed an engineer on paid leave recently after dismissing his claim that its artificial intelligence is sentient, surfacing yet another fracas about the company’s most advanced technology.
	Blake Lemoine, a senior software engineer in Google’s Responsible A.I. organization, said in an interview that he was put on leave Monday. The company’s human resources department said he had violated Google’s confidentiality policy. The day before his suspension, Mr. Lemoine said, he handed over documents to a U.S. senator’s office, claiming they provided evidence that Google and its technology engaged in religious discrimination.

	Google said that its systems imitated conversational exchanges and could riff on different topics, but did not have consciousness. “Our team — including ethicists and technologists — has reviewed Blake’s concerns per our A.I. Principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims,” Brian Gabriel, a Google spokesman, said in a statement. “Some in the broader A.I. community are considering the long-term possibility of sentient or general A.I., but it doesn’t make sense to do so by anthropomorphizing today’s conversational models, which are not sentient.” The Washington Post first reported Mr. Lemoine’s suspension.

    <h3><b>Applications Of Artificial Intelligence in Education</b></h3>
    <h5>Administrative Tasks Automated to Aid Educators<span class="w3-opacity">August 20, 2022</span></h5>
  </div>
  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>
      Although the education sector is the one most influenced by humans, Artificial Intelligence has slowly begun to seep its roots in the education sector as well. Even in the education sector, this slow transition of Artificial Intelligence has helped increase productivity among faculties and helped them concentrate more on students than office or administration work.

      Artificial Intelligence can help educators with non-educational tasks like task-related duties like facilitating and automating personalized messages to students, back-office tasks like grading paperwork, arranging and facilitating parent and guardian interactions, routine issue feedback facilitating, managing enrollment, courses, and HR-related topics.
