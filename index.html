                Hacktoberfest is digital ocean's annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructure-including some of digital ocean's own products-relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don't have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.

        Contributing to open-source isn't just for technical folks who want to write code. There are lots of opportunities to use your professional skills in support of open-source projects. This year, we're making a point to encourage contributions that require some technical experience or none at all. No matter your experience, you can participate in hacktoberfest!

        Hacktoberfest welcomes people of any experience level to participate, and low-code and non-code contributions are fantastic choices for folks who don't have a lot of technical knowledge.Here are some examples of ways you can contribute to open-source projects:
        ~ Writing & Translations
        ~ Technical Documentation
        ~ Design
        ~ Testing
        ~ Graphic Designing
        ~ Video or Media Production

      The importance of artificial intelligence and its subsequent components have been known for quite a long time now.
      They are being looked upon as tools and techniques to make this world a better place. And it’s just not that you
      have to go to these fancy tech gadgets to be able to use them. You can simply look around, and I am sure most of
      your tasks are made smooth by artificial intelligence.
      Its importance lies in making our lives easier. These technologies are a great asset to humans and are programmed
      to reduce the human effort as much as possible. They tend to possess the capability to work in an automated
      fashion.
      These machines tend to speed up your tasks and processes along with a guaranteed level of precision and accuracy,
      and therefore this is what makes them a useful and important tool. Apart from making the world an error-free place
      by their simple and everyday techniques, these technologies and applications are not only related to our general
      and everyday lives.

      When a project is open source, that means anybody is free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license.
      Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption and collaboration, allowing people to spread and improve projects quickly. Also because it gives users a potential to control their own computing, relative to closed source. For example, a business using open source software has the option to hire someone to make custom improvements to the software, rather than relying exclusively on a closed source vendor's product decisions.

      Free software refers to the same set of projects as open source. Sometimes you'll also see these terms combined as “free and open source software” (FOSS) or “free, libre, and open source software” (FLOSS). Free and libre refer to freedom, not price.

      <p>Just me, myself and I, exploring the new universe of Open source projects. I have a heart of love and a interest of changing the world by contributing in projects. I want to share the experience of my new world with you.
      Contributing to Open Source and projects can seem like a daunting process. Your favorite search engine will return a ton of results on guides and repositories to get started. But many times, your search does not yield the result you want, you still do not know how to contribute to Open Source even after reading multiple blog posts.
      <br>
      I have been there myself. I trawled through pages to find great Open Source repositories to contribute to, only to notice that I did not know how to start.Frustrated and a little disappointed, I started focusing on other projects instead.
      Then, NOVUS NEURONS, the reputed technical club of my college sent a message on the group about HACTOBERFEST, and that's where my journey began. I started reseach reagrding the same but couldn't get much benefits from that. Then the club gave me the opportunity of learning all about open source projects and that's when I started the contributions from the very basic.While trying to make my first contributions, I realised that my biggest unknown was not how to add links to markdown or style a page. But how to make a good pull request using git and the command line. The process was slightly less intimidating but it was perfect for a beginner.Not only the contributuions made me intrigued, but the step by step required to find out the open source project, where you can give your share in the making, from the hundreds of projects placed in front of you was also an engaging activity. The process followed being the very basic one- you read new terms, find the meaning and discover new corners of the tech world, and all this is done by yourself. As for the results, one cant be sure of getting the desired outputs but the deep-rooted self-satisfaction in your heart would remain constant throught your hardworking ride!!! 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4 ><b>You are a contributor</b></h4>
      <p> Finding the open source project meant for you requires equal amount of hardwork, energy and enthusiasm. Every indiviual has their own ups and downs in the ride to their first successful contribution. Some have a idea bout it and are just trying it for the first tme while few might be hearing these words for the very first time. For a few this might be just a yearly contributions, while others might be still struggling to understand the basic procedure regarding the same. Whichever category you belong to, everyone has a start some day and you are already here for trying to change the future of development in this technical industry.Just remember this throughout the journay that THE FUTURE CHANGING PROFESsIONALS WERE IN YOUR PLACE SOMETIME IN LIFE!!! </p>

      <h5>DALL.E <span class="w3-opacity">Introducing Outpainting</span></h5>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>OpenAI comes from industry experts who want to bring AI to the masses.
        It's linked to the non-profit research company OpenAI, co-chaired by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, and sponsored by
        companies such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Infosys who are trying to make AI accessible—hence the
        name.
        Contributors discuss their collective efforts to promote and advance AI technologies through long-term research.
        It’s a valuable resource for anyone interested in the future of AI.
        DALL·E’s Edit feature already enables changes within a generated or uploaded image — a capability known as
        Inpainting.
        Now, with Outpainting, users can extend the original image, creating large-scale images in any aspect ratio.
        Outpainting takes into account the image’s existing visual elements — including shadows, reflections, and
        textures — to maintain the context of the original image.
        More than one million people are using DALL·E, the AI system that generates original images and artwork from a
        natural language description,
        as a creative tool today. Artists have already created remarkable images with the new Outpainting feature,
        and helped us better understand its capabilities in the process.
        Outpainting is now available to all DALL·E users on desktop. To discover new realms of creativity, visit

      <h3><b>Google Sidelines Engineer Who Claims Its A.I. Is Sentient</b></h3>
      <h5>Blake Lemoine, the engineer, says that Google’s language model has a soul. The company disagrees.<span

        Google placed an engineer on paid leave recently after dismissing his claim that its artificial intelligence is
        sentient, surfacing yet another fracas about the company’s most advanced technology.
        Blake Lemoine, a senior software engineer in Google’s Responsible A.I. organization, said in an interview that
        he was put on leave Monday. The company’s human resources department said he had violated Google’s
        confidentiality policy. The day before his suspension, Mr. Lemoine said, he handed over documents to a U.S.
        senator’s office, claiming they provided evidence that Google and its technology engaged in religious
        discrimination.
	      
	      
	   Google AI is a division of Google dedicated to artificial intelligence. It was announced at Google I/O 2017 by CEO Sundar Pichai
	      

        Google said that its systems imitated conversational exchanges and could riff on different topics, but did not
        have consciousness. “Our team — including ethicists and technologists — has reviewed Blake’s concerns per our
        A.I. Principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims,” Brian Gabriel, a Google
        spokesman, said in a statement. “Some in the broader A.I. community are considering the long-term possibility of
        sentient or general A.I., but it doesn’t make sense to do so by anthropomorphizing today’s conversational
        models, which are not sentient.” The Washington Post first reported Mr. Lemoine’s suspension.

  <p>As AI technology becomes more integrated into the general economy and civilian sphere, existing legal and normative frameworks may need to be adjusted to cover novel forms of attack such as data poisoning and adversarial examples. Up to this point, data theft has been the main concern in cyberspace. Going forward, hostile actors will likely try to gain access to databases not only to obtain their information, but also to alter and manipulate them. The legal definition of what constitutes a cyber attack may need to be amended to cover these novel threats (Brundage et al. 2018, 57).     <div class="w3-row">

  <p>This work proposes an approach to address automatic
    text summarization. This approach is a trainable summarizer, which
    takes into account several features, including sentence position,
    positive keyword, negative keyword, sentence centrality, sentence
    resemblance to the title, sentence inclusion of name entity, sentence
    inclusion of numerical data, sentence relative length, Bushy path of
    the sentence and aggregated similarity for each sentence to generate
    summaries. First we investigate the effect of each sentence feature on
    the summarization task. Then we use all features score function to
    train genetic algorithm (GA) and mathematical regression (MR)
    models to obtain a suitable combination of feature weights. The
    proposed approach performance is measured at several compression
    rates on a data corpus composed of 100 English religious articles.
    The results of the proposed approach are promising <div class="w3-row">

        Although the education sector is the one most influenced by humans, Artificial Intelligence has slowly begun to
        seep its roots in the education sector as well. Even in the education sector, this slow transition of Artificial
        Intelligence has helped increase productivity among faculties and helped them concentrate more on students than
        office or administration work.

        Artificial Intelligence can help educators with non-educational tasks like task-related duties like facilitating
        and automating personalized messages to students, back-office tasks like grading paperwork, arranging and
        facilitating parent and guardian interactions, routine issue feedback facilitating, managing enrollment,
        courses, and HR-related topics.
